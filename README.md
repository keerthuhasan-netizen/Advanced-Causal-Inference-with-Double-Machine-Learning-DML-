# Advanced-Causal-Inference-with-Double-Machine-Learning-DML-
This project implements the Double Machine Learning (DML) framework to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using high-dimensional data. It includes synthetic data generation, cross-fitting, residualization, nuisance modeling with ML algorithms, and final ATE estimation with detailed evaluation.
